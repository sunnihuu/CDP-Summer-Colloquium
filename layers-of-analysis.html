                <h3>Economic Complexity Framework</h3>
                <p class="author">Author: César Hidalgo & Ricardo Hausmann</p>
                <p class="year">Year: 2009-present</p>
                <p class="format">Format: Theoretical Framework</p>
                <p class="audience">Audience: Development economists, complexity scientists, and policy researchers</p>
                <p class="description">The OEC is built upon the Economic Complexity framework, which conceptualizes economic development as a process of accumulating productive capabilities. The framework breaks down economic complexity into two core components: the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) for countries and the Product Complexity Index (PCI) for products. This structural approach treats economies as networks of capabilities rather than simple aggregates, revealing the underlying knowledge and skill requirements that enable different types of production.</p>

                <p class="audience">Audience: Network scientists, data visualizers, and economic researchers</p>
                <p class="description">The product space represents a structural breakdown of global production as a network where products are nodes and edges represent similarity in required capabilities. This conceptual framework reveals the modular structure of global production, showing clusters of related products and the "distances" between different economic activities. The network structure helps explain why economic diversification follows predictable paths and why some countries struggle to develop certain industries despite apparent advantages.</p>

                <p class="audience">Audience: Development theorists, policy researchers, and economic strategists</p>
                <p class="description">The OEC operationalizes a capability-based theory of economic development, breaking down the concept of "development" into measurable components of productive knowledge. This structural approach treats countries as collections of capabilities rather than simple factor endowments, explaining why similar countries can have vastly different development trajectories. The framework provides a systematic way to understand the knowledge requirements for different economic activities and the path-dependent nature of capability accumulation.</p>

                <p class="author">Author: César Hidalgo & Alexander Simões</p>
                <p class="year">Year: 2011-2013</p>

                <p class="audience">Audience: Academic researchers, development economists, and policy historians</p>
                <p class="description">The OEC emerged from research at MIT's Media Lab, where Hidalgo and Simões developed the Economic Complexity Observatory (ECO) as a tool to visualize and analyze global trade data. The project was born from a desire to make complex economic relationships accessible through interactive visualizations, combining network science with economic theory. The original intent was to challenge traditional development economics by providing empirical evidence for capability-based theories of economic growth.</p>

                <p class="description">The transition from academic research tool to public platform reflects a broader shift in data visualization and open data movements. The OEC's development was driven by the intent to democratize access to complex economic data, moving beyond academic circles to serve policymakers, journalists, educators, and the general public. This evolution involved significant UX/UI redesigns, expanded data coverage, and the development of user-friendly interfaces that maintain analytical rigor while improving accessibility.</p>

                <p class="description">The OEC was intentionally designed to influence economic policy by providing evidence-based tools for development planning. The platform's features—from tariff simulators to growth predictions—reflect a deliberate intent to bridge the gap between academic research and practical policy applications. The historical context includes its adoption by international organizations, national governments, and development agencies as a tool for evidence-based policy making, demonstrating the platform's success in achieving its original intent of making economic complexity accessible to decision-makers.</p>

                <p class="description">The OEC employs sophisticated network visualizations to represent the product space and trade relationships. The visual language uses nodes and edges to create intuitive representations of complex economic relationships, with color coding, size variations, and interactive elements that allow users to explore data at multiple scales. The network style makes abstract economic concepts tangible and reveals patterns that would be invisible in tabular data.</p>

                <p class="audience">Audience: Data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and researchers</p>
                <p class="description">The platform uses treemap visualizations to display hierarchical trade data, where rectangles represent products or countries, with size indicating value and color indicating complexity or growth. This visual style efficiently uses screen space while maintaining readability and enabling quick pattern recognition. The hierarchical approach allows users to drill down from broad categories to specific products, creating an intuitive navigation experience through complex datasets.</p>
