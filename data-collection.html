                <p class="author">Author: Mike Bostock and contributors</p>
                <p class="year">Year: Released in 2011; actively maintained</p>
                <p class="format">Format: Open-source JavaScript library</p>
                <p class="audience">Audience: Web developers, data scientists, and visualization specialists</p>
                <p class="description">D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers using SVG, HTML, and CSS. It enables binding data to the DOM and applying data-driven transformations to generate complex visual representations. The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) uses D3.js as its core visualization engine to create highly interactive, dynamic graphics. D3.js allows OEC to bind complex trade data to visual elements, animate transitions, control scalable SVG graphics, and integrate interactivity like tooltips and drill-down features—turning large global trade datasets into intuitive, user-friendly visual narratives.</p>

                <p class="author">Author: Center for Collective Learning (CCL)</p>
                <p class="year">Year: Ongoing research; foundational work began in the early 2010s</p>
                <p class="format">Format: Research-focused web resource</p>

                <p class="description">The Center for Collective Learning (CCL) is a multidisciplinary research laboratory focused on understanding the growth, accumulation, and value of socially embedded knowledge. Based at the Toulouse School of Economics and Corvinus University of Budapest, CCL pioneers the application of machine learning techniques to economic development questions. Their work in economic complexity involves developing predictive models to understand the evolution of economies, from cities to nations. CCL's research informs sustainable economic development strategies and has led to the creation of numerous public data observatories, including the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), DataViva, and DataUSA.</p>

                <h3>Economic Complexity: Theory and Applications</h3>
                <p class="author">Author: César A. Hidalgo</p>
                <p class="year">Year: 2021</p>

                <p class="audience">Audience: Academics, policymakers, and researchers in economics, development studies, and related fields</p>
                <p class="description">This comprehensive review, published in Nature Reviews Physics, delves into the field of economic complexity, focusing on two primary areas: the literature on relatedness, which examines the evolution of specialization patterns, and the literature on metrics of economic complexity, which employs dimensionality reduction techniques to create indices of economic sophistication. The paper explores how these metrics are predictive of variations in income, economic growth, emissions, and income inequality. Additionally, it introduces the Economic Complexity Observatory as a tool for understanding the evolution of countries' productive structures and trade relationships.</p>
